# ðŸŽ“ Bio.
I am working in the [***Laboratory for Image Information Communications***](http://www.iic.ecei.tohoku.ac.jp/index.html) at [***Tohoku University***](https://www.tohoku.ac.jp/en/), supervised by [**Prof. Shinichiro OMACHI**](http://www.iic.ecei.tohoku.ac.jp/~machi/index-j.html). I obtained my B.Eng. and M.Eng. (supervised by [*Prof. Zetao JIANG*](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0914-2131)) from the [*Guilin University of Electronic Technology*](https://www.gliet.edu.cn/index.htm) in 2018 and 2021, respectively. As a research assistant at [***Tohoku University***](https://www.tohoku.ac.jp/en/) and [***Harvard Medical School***](https://hms.harvard.edu/), I focus on computer vision and deep learning, with a particular interest in **image processing** and **super-resolution**.
