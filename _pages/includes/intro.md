# ðŸŽ“ Bio.
I am working in the [***Laboratory for Image Information Communications***](http://www.iic.ecei.tohoku.ac.jp/index.html) at [***Tohoku University***](https://www.tohoku.ac.jp/en/), supervised by [**Prof. Shinichiro OMACHI**](http://www.iic.ecei.tohoku.ac.jp/~machi/index-j.html). I obtained my B.Eng. and M.Eng. (supervised by [*Prof. Zetao JIANG*](https://www.guet.edu.cn/people/info/1003/1740.htm)) from the *[Guilin University of Electronic Technology](https://www.guet.edu.cn/)* in 2018 and 2021, respectively. My research interests include computer vision and deep learning, particularly focusing on **image processing** and **super-resolution**.
